            | Kit Kogan: Software developer, creative thinker, and lifelong learner. Minneapolis, MN.
            | I am currently pursuing a Full Stack JavaScript certification through the Treehouse TechDegree program. 
            | I have always had a strong ability to learn new technical and creative concepts, but having the opportunity 
            | to advance my skillset in such a focused way has affirmed that my effort in achieving this goal has been well placed. 
            | The coursework and foundational projects I've completed have been both a fun and challenging experience. 
            | I look forward to continuing to build my personal tool kit with as many syntaxes and development concepts as I can!
            | Additionally, my long-term professional experience working with youth, strong attention to detail, natural inquisitiveness
            | and varied personal interests give me a unique point of view that would be an asset to any development team.
